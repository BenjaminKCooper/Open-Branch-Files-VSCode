## Resources Used:
- The scaffolding for this extension began its life as a [Yeoman generated VSCode Extension](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-generator-code)
- The icons that I used in my icon for this extension were downloaded from [Ionicons](https://ionicons.com/) ([Material Design Document Icon](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionicons/blob/master/src/svg/md-document.svg) and [Material Design Git Branch Icon](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionicons/blob/master/src/svg/md-git-branch.svg))
- Git helper functions use two great libraries:
  - [isomorphic-git](https://github.com/isomorphic-git/isomorphic-git)
  - [git-js](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js)

**Please Note:** this has only been tested on MacOS. Should work in a Linux environment just fine, an update will be needed for Windows.
